# haul

This project is a thrift website for people to be able to see thrift stores near them, check ratings and rate them themselves. They can see all of the cool finds people got and where they got them. There will be an algorithm to push content that has gotten lots of attention so that other people can see all of the cool stuff.

How to setup the dev environment: Fairly straightforward. 1) Clone the repo 2) npm install all the packages 3) ask a team member to share the .env with you to get up and running locally and make sure that the links point to localhost instead of the deployed site url
